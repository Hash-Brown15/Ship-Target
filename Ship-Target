"""An example of using animate() and clock scheduling to move actors around.

There are two actors in this example, each with a different movement strategy.

The block
---------

The block moves in a loop aroun the screen

* We schedulethe move_block() function to be called every 2 seconds using
clock.schedule_interval.
* The next position of the block is given by calling next() on a "cycle"
object, returned by itertools.cycle(). This will cycle through the block
coordinates we provide it ,repeating without end.
* We use animate() to move the block


The ship
--------

The ship moves in a random dance in the middle of the screen. The ship
flips back and forth between a rotation phase and movement phase 


* next_ship_target(): pick a new target location for the ship at random, and
animate rotating the ship to aim it. When the rotation animation is
complete, we will call move_ship().
* move_ship(): Move the ship to its target. When the move animation is
complete, we will call Next_ship_target().
